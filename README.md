# Packforge

Packforge is a planned modern executable packer focused on predictable behavior,
transparent output, and measurable size/startup tradeoffs.

The packer tool will ship as a single binary per host platform and produce
self-contained executables. The first supported target is Linux ELF on x86-64.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Packforge is currently a planning scaffold. It does not pack executables yet.

## Why another packer?

Packforge is not trying to replace decades of format support on day one. It is
designed around a narrower modern contract:

- deterministic, reproducible packed output;
- safe, bounded parsing and decompression;
- explicit compatibility tiers instead of best-effort mutation;
- automatic size-versus-startup optimization;
- reversible and inspectable packaging;
- signing-aware workflows and provenance metadata;
- no encryption, anti-debugging, polymorphism, or evasion behavior.

The word "better" is treated as a benchmarkable claim. Packforge will publish a
corpus, measurement method, failures, and comparisons instead of relying on a
single compression-ratio number.

## Planned CLI

```text
packforge pack [--profile fast|balanced|small|auto] <input> [-o <output>]
packforge unpack <input> [-o <output>]
packforge inspect <input>
packforge verify <input>
packforge benchmark <input>
```

For now, the scaffold supports only `--help`, `--version`, and `status`.

## Project boundaries

The first production target is a reversible ELF packer for trusted, first-party
executables. Packforge is not a code protector or an obfuscator. Unsupported
formats or binary features will fail closed without modifying the input.

[roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md), and [security policy](SECURITY.md).
